    "# ABC article: Trump and Swan talk about Covid19 deaths\n",
    "This notebook was inspired partly by an Aussie ABC article and completely by a family member posted this article to a family WhatsApp group chat. The interview really struck a curiousity in me - not because I am a Trump supporter (actually quite the contrary) but because the interviewer actually didn't make much sense to me from a statistical viewpoint when he says **\"death as a proportion of population\"**. The questions I initially had were:\n",
    "- do we really need to know the population of people tested for Covid19? Such as Trump's perspective.\n",
    "    - if so, how do we use this statistic to influence a perspective?\n",
    "- given the overall population size of two countries and a death rate from covid19, can we make assumptions about the death toll of covid19 for a given country?\n",
    "    - if so, how do we interpret deaths? \n",
    "        - do we consider all deaths (by all causes including covid19) by total overall population\n",
    "        - do we consider testing rate for a given country?\n",
    "            - **this is interesting!** So when we say *death by covid19* we infer that those people first tested positive for covid19 and as a result of the order of least precedence, we conclude this person died of covid19\n",
    "                - another interesting avenue to consider here would be to get the cases of comorbidity among those that are considered in the statistic of *death by covid19*. Comorbidity in this case being the cooccurrence of other existing medical conditions in addition to covid19.\n",
    "    - if so, how do we influence an audience to consider well-known political issues that exist today? Such as healthcare access in the USA, political structures for each country, etc."

    "Let's say we are interested in a total overall population as we only want to know who died as a result of covid19. Obviously to get a covid19 death count, we assume those persons first tested positive for covid19. This raises an interesting query, if a person was not first tested positive for covid19, then the death of that person would not constitute a covid19 death, right? This brings us to the question - should we consider the rate of testing in each country. Let's consider the case where $x$ people were never tested for covid19, that would result in $x$ non-covid19 deaths, i.e., their death would not be considered in our death count. \n",
